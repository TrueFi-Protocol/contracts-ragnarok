Name: 4_CRITICAL_UNCHECKED_INITIALIZATION

Description:

In both `ManagedPortfolio.sol:createBulletLoan` and `BulletLoans.sol:createLoan`
check for `repaymentAmount` >= `principalAmount` is missing

A potential manager can exploit this by setting values where
repaymentAmount is lower than principalAmount.

This will cause the contract to mint more value to
Manager as a part of fees.

Combined with fore-mentioned `2_HIGH_PUBLIC_MODIFIER` this is a high risk bug
with potential to drain the system.

STEPS TO RECREATE:
Self-explanatory

The manager can call

```
createBulletLoan(
        uint256 loanDuration,
        address borrower,
        uint256 principalAmount,
        uint256 repaymentAmount
    )
```

with `principalAmount = 2000` and `repaymentAmount = 0`
