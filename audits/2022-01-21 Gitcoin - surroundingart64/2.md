Name: 2_HIGH_PUBLIC_MODIFIER
Description: The following function should not be public.
A modifier should be added like onlyManager or onlyManagedPortfolio.

function `createLoan`

Failure Points:
Even though no fund will be lost, this will change the
calculations of liquidity without minting.
This can result in changed behavior in `liquidValue() + illiquidValue()`
If this value is used to provide supply to DEX/CEX,
a hacker can manipulate these values.

STEPS TO RECREATE:
Self-explanatory
Anyone can call the function
