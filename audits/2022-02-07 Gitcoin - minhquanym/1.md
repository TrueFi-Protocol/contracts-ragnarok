## Malicious manager could take advantage of uncheck borrower address 
- **File**: 
	- ManagedPortfolio.sol: `0xf98b1BE69ca26D5b571c7359074A635a140308C1` 
	- BulletLoans.sol: `0x8ddf7021fEA12A277F75414a1BAC32F1586cB5E6`
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Description**:
	- In function `createBulletLoan` in ManagedPortfolio.sol and `createLoan` in BulletLoans.sol, check for `borrower != address(ManagedPortfolio)` is lacking 
	- A manager can exploit this by setting `borrower` to address of `ManagedPortfolio` when calling `createBulletLoan`
	- This will cause the calculation of `value` function incorrect - **larger** than actual value
	- Functions calling `value` will work incorrectly too.
		- `getAmountToMint`: mint **less / wrong** share for following depositor

- STEP TO RECREATE: Self-explanatory
	- The manager can call 
	````
	createBulletLoan(
	        uint256 loanDuration,
	        address borrower,
	        uint256 principalAmount,
	        uint256 repaymentAmount
	    )
	````
	with `borrower = address(ManagedPorfolio)`
