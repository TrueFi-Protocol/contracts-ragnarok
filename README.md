# ðŸ’¡ Intro
TrueFi is a decentralized protocol for uncollateralized lending.
TrueFi Protocol v2 enables third parties to create and manage portfolios of financials instruments (for the first version of the protocol see our previous [repository](https://github.com/trusttoken/smart-contracts)).
This repository contains smart contracts used in Protocol v2.
Contracts are written in Solidity.
All key functionalities are tested with attached TypeScript test suite.
Apart from contracts and tests repository contains scripts used for deployment and maintenance of existing infrastructure.
